Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome though as mentioned in the readme, at the moment this is very specific to my thesis. I will clean it up and generalise it once my thesis is finished (June). It will probably be easier to contribute then rather then trying to make sense of it at the moment. It is usable though for others with a bit of modification!

Fork the repository → Push to your fork → Submit a pull request.

Please be consistent with the code style.
